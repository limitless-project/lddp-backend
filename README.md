Limitless, Effortless, Immutable, and Fast data transfer protocol.

## What is LDDP?
LDDP stands for Limitless Decentralized Data Protocol. LDDP lets users easily browse websites and hashes on the IPFS blockchain by using HRSNs
## What are HRSNs?
HRSNs, or Human Readable Site Names, are masks that are used for a user's IPNS.
Once the user registers a completely free name, they can point it at their IPNS.
Anyone can then visit their IPNS from their HRSN.
## Ok then, but isn't this just reinventing the wheel?
Although there are many programs similar to the HRSNS, LDDP is different.
LDDP is built to be the HTTP of the blockchain.
It has built in support for authentication, custom headers, and more.
## Cool! When can I get it?
LDDP is still in development, but the more users like you contribute and test, the faster the development will grow.
